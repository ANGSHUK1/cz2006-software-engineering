## Setting up local environment (Windows)

This is a very simplified guide on setting up local environment for Windows

Pre-requisite:

1. Installed `python3`
2. Installed `pip`

### Setting up repository

1. Go to a folder where you want the repository to be in
2. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/adriangohjw/cz2006-software-engineering.git`

### Setting up PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the relational DBMS of choice in this project
 
1. Download and install PostgreSQL from [Windows installers](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
 2. Use the following credentials during the installation (otherwise you can update the Config file):
	 1. Username = `postgres` and password = `localhostdbpassword`

### Setup virtual environment in project

In Windows CMD, ensure you are in the folder of your repository

1. Run `python â€“m venv venv`
2. Run `venv\Scripts\activate` 
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

All required packages should have been installed!

`venv\Scripts\activate` is also the <b>command to enter your virtual environment</b> whenever you want to run the application on CMD

### Setup local database
In Windows CMD, ensure you are in the folder of your repository

1. Run `python manage.py db init` 
2. Run `python manage.py db migrate`
3. Run `python manage.py db upgrade`

If you face error, delete the folder "migrations" and try the above steps again.

## To run the application
`python run.py`

## Testing API endpoints

Postman is a Collaboration Platform for API Development

1. Download and install Postman from [this link](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. Go to Postman and [join the team](https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=bd6c25557a885c34cf660dff1156c0a8&ws=3f9319a1-921e-4a92-af38-cc946d30ee25)

## To run unit testing
`python tests.py`
